# Gardener

Why don't we use monitoring to monitor my plants!?!??! Said wizard Tim.  
Why not? Said we.  
Thus was born this project.  
Now monitoring can tell you when to water your plants and other gardening related things!  
This project is a functional POC of using Rackspace monitoring for monitoring things that aren't servers but instead in this example are IoT devices in a garden. It is worth noting that a plastic case is used to protect the devices from the water.
